# User: Can you write it in the library combination of Typer, openai

# Sage: Certainly! Here's an example [Python script](poe://www.poe.com/_api/key_phrase?phrase=Python%20script&prompt=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20Python%20script.) that uses the [Typer library](poe://www.poe.com/_api/key_phrase?phrase=Typer%20library&prompt=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20Typer%20library.) and the OpenAI GPT-3 API to create a command-line interface for a chatbot that can generate text based on user input:

# ```
import openai
import os
import typer

# Set up the OpenAI API credentials
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]


# Define a function to interact with the model
def chat_with_gpt(prompt, model):
    # Generate text based on the prompt
    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=prompt,
    )
    # Extract the generated text from the response
    generated_text = completion.choices[0].message
    # Return the generated text
    return generated_text


# Define the Typer app
app = typer.Typer()


# Define the chat command
@app.command()
def chat(model: str = typer.Argument("gpt-3.5-turbo")):
    """
    Start a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses based on user input.
    """
    # Print welcome message
    typer.echo("Welcome to the GPT-3.5 chatbot!")
    prompt = []
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = typer.prompt("You: ")
        prompt.append({'role': 'user', 'content': user_input})
        # Generate a response using the GPT-3 model
        response = chat_with_gpt(prompt, model)
        prompt.append(response)
        # Print the generated response
        typer.echo(f"ChatGPT: {response['content']}")

# Run the Typer app
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     app()
# ```
#
# This script uses the Typer library to define a command-line interface for the chatbot, and the [OpenAI API](poe://www.poe.com/_api/key_phrase?phrase=OpenAI%20API&prompt=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20OpenAI%20API.) to generate text based on user input. The `chat_with_gpt` function interacts with the GPT-3 model to generate text based on user input, and the `chat` command starts the chatbot and prompts the user for input.
#
# To run the script, save it to a file with a `.py` extension and run it from the command line using the `python` command. For example, if you saved the script to a file named `chatbot.py`, you could run it using the following command:
#
# ```
# python chatbot.py chat
# ```
#
# This would start the chatbot and prompt the user for input. The user can then enter text and the chatbot will generate a response based on the input, using the [OpenAI GPT](poe://www.poe.com/_api/key_phrase?phrase=OpenAI%20GPT&prompt=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20OpenAI%20GPT.)-3 language model.
#
# I hope this example helps you get started with using the Typer library and the OpenAI API to create a command-line chatbot that generates text based on user input! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
